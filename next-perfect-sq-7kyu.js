/*
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. 
Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language.
 You may assume the argument is non-negative. */

function findNextSquare(sq) {
  const root = Math.sqrt(sq);
  if (root % 1 === 0) {
    return (root + 1) ** 2;
  } else {
    return -1;
  }
}

console.log(findNextSquare(121));
console.log(findNextSquare(114));
